# URLDrill Server: Comprehensive Technical Documentation

## Overview

URLDrill Server is a sophisticated distributed web scraping management system designed to coordinate large-scale URL scraping operations across multiple worker nodes. Built on modern Python technologies with an asynchronous architecture, it provides real-time monitoring, granular control, and comprehensive analytics for web scraping operations targeting shortened URL services.

## Purpose and Goals

The primary purpose of URLDrill is to systematically scan and archive content behind various URL shortening services (Bitly, s.id, shorturl.at, tiny.cc, and shorturl.gg) by generating potential short codes and resolving them to their final destinations. The system aims to:

- Create a comprehensive archive of content behind shortened URLs
- Provide statistical insights into URL shortening service usage patterns
- Enable large-scale distributed web scraping with centralized management
- Offer real-time monitoring of scraping operations and system health
- Maintain persistent state across scraping sessions to avoid redundant work

### Database Schema Design

The application employs a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with optimized tables for different aspects of the scraping operation:

#### Workers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS workers (
    worker_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                       -- UUID identifier
    api_key TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,                     -- Authentication key
    cpu_usage NUMERIC(5,2) DEFAULT 0,                 -- System metrics
    ram_usage NUMERIC(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
    disk_name TEXT DEFAULT 0,
    disk_usage NUMERIC(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
    net_in BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    net_out BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    public_ip INET,
    created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    queue INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,                 -- URLs in processing
    has_restarted BOOL DEFAULT TRUE                   -- Restart state flag
);
```

#### Data Storage Tables
- `scraped_pages`: Successfully scraped content with full metadata
- `noredirect`: URLs that failed to redirect properly
- `big_queue`: Primary task queue for URL processing
- `lastcount`: Persistent state for URL generation services

#### Management Tables
- `statistics`: Aggregated performance and operational metrics
- `statefull`: System state controls (worker hold, queue hold, delay)
- `scraper_admin`: Administrator authentication credentials

### Key Technical Features

#### Asynchronous Architecture
The entire system is built around Python's async/await pattern, enabling high concurrency:
- Async database connection pooling with configurable limits (min_size=20, max_size=200)
- Non-blocking HTTP request handling through FastAPI
- Concurrent URL generation across multiple services
- Batched database operations for improved performance

#### Distributed Worker System
- Automatic worker registration with UUID and API key generation
- Heartbeat mechanism with comprehensive system metrics reporting
- Graceful restart management with state persistence
- Automatic cleanup of idle workers (1-minute timeout)

#### Intelligent URL Generation
The system employs combinatorial generation across multiple URL shortening services:

```python
# Example from generator.py
bitly_allowed = [
    'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 
    'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 
    # ... full character set
    '8', '9', '-', '_'
]

async def generate_bitly():
    last_index = await get_state('bitly')
    current_index = last_index
    result = []
    
    for length in range(1, 25):  # Generate URLs of varying lengths
        combinations = itertools.product(bitly_allowed, repeat=length)
        # Slice only the remaining needed items
        for combo in itertools.islice(combinations, current_index, current_index + one_chunk - len(result)):
            result.append(''.join(combo))
        # ... continues with state persistence
```

#### Result Processing Pipeline
- Three-state result handling: success, noredirect, notfound
- Batched database writes with configurable cache limits (500 items)
- Periodic automatic flushing with 10-second timeout
- Statistical aggregation with batched updates

#### Administrative Controls
Granular system management through the dashboard:
- Worker hold: Immediately stops all scraping operations
- Queue hold: Gradually stops operations by preventing new task generation
- Adjustable delay: Configurable delay between batch processing (0-50 seconds)
- Administrative actions: Worker DB wiping, session revocation, forced restarts

## User Experience and Workflows

    key3 = generate_key()
    # Stores hashed password and session keys
```

## Conclusion

URLDrill Server represents a sophisticated approach to large-scale web scraping operations targeting URL shortening services. Its distributed architecture, comprehensive monitoring capabilities, and granular control mechanisms make it suitable for research, archiving, and intelligence gathering applications. While powerful, operators should carefully consider the ethical, legal, and technical implications of deployment at scale.

The system's modular design and modern technical foundation provide excellent opportunities for extension and customization to meet specific operational requirements while maintaining performance and reliability across distributed scraping operations.
